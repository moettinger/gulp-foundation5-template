# Gulp & Foundation 5 Template - Tuned

This template combines Gulp.js and the Zurb Foundation responsive framework. I have also added some optimization tasks to keep it lean:

* Image smushing
* JS & CSS concatenation and minification 

For information related to Gulp.js or Foundation, visit these sources:

* Gulp.js: [http://gulpjs.com/](http://gulpjs.com/)
* Zurb Foundation: [http://foundation.zurb.com/](http://foundation.zurb.com/)

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
bower install
gulp
```
